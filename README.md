## My Notes and small side projects while learning Redux, Typescript and React-Hooks.
 React hooks are conventional and super easy to use alternative for same state storage methods and lifecycle methods used in class components.

React hooks provide the same functionality with ease of use. 

Different react Hooks:
 - useState 
 - useCallback
 - useEffect
 - useReducer
 - useLayoutEffect
 - useRef
 - useMemo
 - useImperativeHandle
 - useContext
 
 
 You can also create custom hooks to further improve efficiency and clean code development.
Several hooks use a second argument of array of dependancies.
